## üìå Project Overview

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

This end-to-end data analysis project explores Amazon's e-commerce performance using:
- **SQL** for advanced data transformation (PostgreSQL)
- **Power BI** for interactive visualizations
- **CSV datasets** containing sales, products, and customer data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 14 |
| **ETL** | CSV Import |
| **Analysis** | Advanced SQL (CTEs, Window Functions) |
| **Visualization** | Power BI |

## üéØ Objective

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance

## üìã Core Research Questions

### üìå **Easy-Medium Questions**

#### **Q1. Top Selling Products**  
*Query the top 10 products by total sales value. Include product name, total quantity sold, and total sales value.*

#### **Q2. Revenue by Category**  
*Calculate total revenue generated by each product category. Include the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.*

#### **Q3. Average Order Value (AOV)**  
*Compute the average order value for each customer. Include only customers with more than 5 orders.*

#### **Q4. Monthly Sales Trend**  
*Query monthly total sales over the past year. Display the sales trend, grouping by month, return current_month sale, last month sale.*

#### **Q5. Customers with No Purchases**  
*Find customers who have registered but never placed an order. List customer details and the time since their registration.*

---

### üìå **Medium Questions**

#### **Q6. Least-Selling Categories by State**  
*Identify the least-selling product category for each state. Include the total sales for that category within each state.*

#### **Q7. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**  
*Calculate the total value of orders placed by each customer over their lifetime. Rank customers based on their CLTV.*

#### **Q8. Inventory Stock Alerts**  
*Query products with stock levels below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 10 units). Include last restock date and warehouse information.*

#### **Q9. Shipping Delays**  
*Identify orders where the shipping date is later than 3 days after the order date. Include customer, order details, and delivery provider.*

#### **Q10. Payment Success Rate**  
*Calculate the percentage of successful payments across all orders. Include breakdowns by payment status (e.g., failed, pending).*

### üìå **Advanced Questions & Analysis**

#### **Q11. Top Performing Sellers**  
*Find the top 5 sellers based on total sales value. Include both successful and failed orders, and display their percentage of successful orders.*

#### **Q12. Product Profit Margin**  
*Calculate the profit margin for each product (difference between price and cost of goods sold). Rank products by their profit margin, showing highest to lowest.*

#### **Q13. Most Returned Products**  
*Query the top 10 products by the number of returns. Display the return rate as a percentage of total units sold for each product.*

#### **Q14. Orders Pending Shipment**  
*Find orders that have been paid but are still pending shipment. Include order details, payment date, and customer information.*

#### **Q15. Inactive Sellers**  
*Identify sellers who haven't made any sales in the last 6 months. Show the last sale date and total sales from those sellers.*

#### **Q16. Customer Segmentation**  
*Identify customers as returning or new based on their return history. If the customer has done more than 5 returns, categorize them as returning, otherwise new.*

#### **Q17. Cross-Sell Opportunities**  
*Find customers who purchased product A but not product B (e.g., AirPods but not AirPods Max). Suggest cross-sell opportunities by displaying matching categories.*

#### **Q18. Top Customers by State**  
*Identify the top 5 customers with the highest number of orders for each state. Include the number of orders and total sales for each customer.*

#### **Q19. Revenue by Shipping Provider**  
*Calculate the total revenue handled by each shipping provider. Include the total number of orders handled and the average delivery time.*

#### **Q20. Declining Product Revenue**  
*Find the top 10 products with the highest decreasing revenue ratio compared to last year (2022) and current year (2023).*

## üèÅ Conclusion
This advanced SQL project successfully demonstrates my ability to solve real-world e-commerce problems using structured queries. From improving customer retention to optimizing inventory and logistics, the project provides valuable insights into operational challenges and solutions.
By completing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how SQL can be used to tackle complex data problems and drive business decision-making.

## üîí Data Confidentiality
*Due to confidentiality agreements, the original datasets cannot be shared publicly. Sample queries demonstrate the analytical approach using synthetic/scrambled data.*
